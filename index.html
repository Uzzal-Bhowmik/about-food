            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>Hi, I'm Uzzal. I've been working with food ever since I was a kid. I've a great passion for learning and
                then
                applying new things on various kinds of foods. As a professional who has been living with food and
                cuisine for
                a long time I've gained a lot of knowledge about food. And I'm thrilled to share those with you. I've
                also been a food nutritionist for almost a
                decade
                and there are thousands of people who really appriciated my special food techniques that I've exhibited
                here.</p>

        <h1>Our Recipes</h1>
        <h4>These are our most famous recipes. The thing that most people like about these recipes is that we don't
            follow
            any strict diet, we focus on your wellness.</h4>

            <h1 class="recipes-div-fix">Chickpea Bowls</h1>
            <p class="recipes-div-fix">One of my favorite parts of this dish is really the bright and creamy tahini
                sauce. We make this sauce on a regular basis at my house. It’s great drizzled on fresh greens, roasted
                veggies, or baked sweet potatoes, too!. Voila this is Chickpea Bowls</p>

            <h1 class="recipes-div-fix">Pasta With Pesto</h1>
            <p class="recipes-div-fix">There are a lot of pasta salads out there, but here’s why you should memorize
                this one: The dressing is easily made from things already in your pantry (and totally tastes like your
                favorite bottled Italian dressing). Enjoy!</p>

            <h1 class="recipes-div-fix">Veggie Salad</h1>
            <p class="recipes-div-fix">I set out to create a better meatless Italian chopped salad, and here it is.
                You’ll find most of the usual ingredients, including crisp lettuce, radicchio, red onion, fresh
                tomatoes, pepperoncini peppers and provolone cheese. I tried a few other kinds of cheese.</p>
